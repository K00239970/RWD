	<br><p id="mainbodytext">The video game content live streaming niche is dominated by two factors: the streaming platform Twitch and the 
		video game Fortnite. It’s very hard to mention the words “Twitch” and “Fortnite” without mentioning the word “ninja,” which is the nickname Tyler 
		Blevins used during his rise to live streaming superstardom.
		Blevins was already an established protagonist of news stories thanks to Fortnite’s moment in the eye of popular culture. But when the news broke 
		that he was leaving Twitch for Mixer, it was more than just a newsworthy article.
	<br><br>
		Ninja’s move to Mixer sent ripples through the whole niche and probably prompted numerous people to ask themselves, “Is it time to start 
		streaming to Mixer instead of Twitch?”. In the aftermath of Ninja’s move, many people had a positive answer to that question.
		The only problem, as we know now, was that most of them were streamers. We know that the amount of content on the platform has increased, but 
		the number of hours watched hasn’t. The fact that Mixer’s having trouble with growing its fan base didn’t discourage another popular streamer, 
		Shroud, from making the move.
		He was soon followed by King Gothalion, also a Twitch streamer with a following. It seems that Ninja, Shroud, Gothalion, and all the other Mixer 
		streamers know what they’re doing — they are streaming at a professional level, and the choice of platform matters a lot.
	<br><br>
		Being a part of the Microsoft family gives Mixer some big advantages almost by default. It comes packaged into the world’s leading operating 
		system, Windows 10. It also has native integration with the Xbox consoles. The bottom line is that Mixer has a friendly community, great support
		staff, and interactivity features. FTL is a thing of beauty, really. Unless you’re using Mac computers or PlayStation consoles to stream, 
		you probably already have access to Mixer.
	<br><br>
		Twitch is special among streaming platforms because it’s been spun into existence by separating from Justin.tv, the original live streaming platform.
		Back then, Twitch was the gaming division of the platform. Today, it’s the number-one streaming platform for gamers that also hosts non-gaming 
		content. The bottom line is that, besides being the biggest live streaming platform, Twitch is also a good streaming platform that has 
		plenty to offer to streamers and viewers alike.
